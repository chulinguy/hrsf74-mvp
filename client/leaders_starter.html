            <h3 class="blog-post-title">Beginner Leader's Mentality</h3>

              <p><strong>In my opinion, the first step to transition from a beginner leader to an intermediate leader is the admitting that learning to lead is quite difficult and be okay with that difficulty.  </strong>
              This is quite a profound sentence, so I recommend you to read that again.  Tango looks simple but there are a lot of subtle elements at play; think of tango as poker, and know that you can still have fun as a beginner poker player!
              </p>
              
              <p>I have a theory that quite often the beginner leaders that find leading in tango super difficult to the point they feel they are bringing shame to their family names are the ones that become great leaders.  
              The basis behind this theory is that these leaders are simply <em>more aware of what's going on</em>, so they are sensitive to every minor mistake.  
              I also see naturally-confident leaders get stuck, unable to become better because they are oblivious to their weaknesses and instead, rely on their followers to compensate (or their teachers to yell at them).  
              Therefore, the next time you come close to that leader's panic, remember that it is actually a good sign! It means you are experiencing and learning new elements.

            <h3 class="blog-post-title">How to Multi-task on the Dance Floor</h3>
            

            <p>If I have to sum up why learning to lead as a beginner is so tortuous, it would be this one word: "multitasking". 
                This is the mystery that explains why tango can be simple yet difficult at the same time.  
                There are essentially four elements at play when you lead (and follow too!): yourself, your partner, music, and floor traffic.   
                Understanding this, we can employ the following FDA-approved strategies to help manage these four elements: 
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>An interesting conceptual model is that leaders work to earn a currency called "trust" from followers, then leaders can spend that currency buying leading fancy moves or repaying minor mistake debts, etc.  
                  You don't want to run up loans and debts because some followers charge very high interest rates (they probably have mafia connections)!
                  It's better to save up lots of trust currency so on days where you have low credit scores, followers are still willing to work with you.   
                  As a serious aside. while my ego is my main drive to improve my tango off the dance floor, what inspires me to improve on the dance floor is actually the amazing but scary realization that I have collected so much trust currency that I feel wealthy.  
              </li>
              <li>You don't start a conversation with a stranger/acquintance without saying "hi" or "how are you?" first, so there is no need to rush into steps.  Take things slow and simple so both of you understand each others' rthyme (advanced dancers would try to break in sync with you) and also, learn your follower's tendancies.  
                  I remember dancing with this follower for the first time where I did only weight changes in place for 20 seconds.  It felt like an eternity at the time but as a result that dance became great. 
              </li>
              <li>I am not against a little bit of experimenting on the dance floor, but try to experiment with familiar ingredients! That means, experiement with songs you know, less crowded floor, and after you established some familiarity with that follower.  
                  The corollary is of course, dance simple with unfamiliar songs, crowded floor, and followers you haven't established familiarity yet.  
              </li>
            </ul>
          <p>Not sure if you noticed a pattern here, but honestly, "dance simple" is the universal solution for managing multi-tasking in tango.  
             In the near future, you will develop good habits and those good habits will allow you to free up even more brain power in order to "dance fancy".  
             As tango teacher <em>Glenn Corteza</em> once said to me,
             <pre><code>Leading in tango is like computer programing; to debug, it helps to say your code out loud mentally; otherwise, stay to familiar codes!</code></pre> 
             Maybe that's why there are so many software programers in Bay Area tango community.   
          </p>
             
          <p><strong>"Dance simple" also allows you to improve the quality of your lead</strong>, which is defined by the "3 C's" of tango by tango teacher <em>Homer Ladas</em>:
            <pre><code> Clarity, Consistency, and Comfort </code></pre>
            You might wonder why "connection" isn't one of the C's; truth is connection depends more on followers than on leaders.  
          </p>
